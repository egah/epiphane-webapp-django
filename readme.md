### Dependencies 
This project was build with : 
- python 3.10
- Django 4.1.4

### Deployment
I deployed this Django application using Heroku. Heroku is a platform-as-a-service (PAAS) solution for deploying applications. Heroku allows for three methods for application deployment:

<ul>
<li>Heroku CLI</li>
<li>Github</li>
<li>Container registry
</li>

</ul>
Heroku allows you to create a custom pipeline for your application. For example, you can create an automatic deploy that is triggered by a `git push` to your GitHub branch.
